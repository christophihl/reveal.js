## Contextual Advertising
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->


* Targeted and personlaized advertising based on collected information:
  * about users
    * Demographics
    * Interests
    * Location
  * about context
    * Time of day
    * Recent online activity (e.g., products viewed, sites visited)
* Collected by: 
  * market-makers (e.g., Google and Facebook)
  * publishers and e-commerce sites (e.g., The New York Times)
  * data aggregators (e.g., Acxiom)


----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Sponsored Search

----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Advertising Auctions

* Bidding on clicks (versus impressions, add-to-carts, purchases (conversions), app installs, or writing reviews)
  * Real-time exchanges typically operate with per-impression rather than per-click payments, in order to avoid the need for complicated infrastructure to track
clicks and collect payments.
* Sponsored search: also bidding on position and keywords
* Publishers sell ad space (supply side) 
* Advertisers buy ad space (demand side)
* Ad exchanges are a market places
* Ad networks aggregate inventory from publishers and the sell those to advertisers (via ad exchanges)
* Real time (programmatic) bidding (vs. standing bids) on ad exchanges allow retargeting and ad personalization
* Consider bids and clear auctions in hundreds of milliseconds (w/o disrupting user experience)


----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Advertising Auctions
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

* Different design:
  * Generalized second-price (GSP) auction:
    * Google and Bing
  * VCG auctions: 
    * Facebook and Google (on behalf of publishers in Google's ad network.) for selling contextual ads
    * Other search engines swithed from GSP to VCG (e.g., Yandex, in 2015). 
  * First-price sealed-bid auction: revival

## Advertising Auctions
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

<img data-src="img/designs.png"  height="200" width="1000">




----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Design Tradeoffs

* Reasons for GSP (to exist and still be around):
  * By accident!  
    * Google in fact wanted VCG
  * Easy to explain
  * Short-term revenue loss
    * even if longer-term effect expected to be neutral (Theorem).
  * Re-engineering cost
    * Switching to VCG would cause disruption to the various algorithmic systems used to optimize ad campaigns.



----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Design Tradeoffs
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

* Reasons in favor of VCG:
  * Strategy-proofness:
    * advertisers can use same bid across multiple (VCG-based) ad systems
    * easier to estimate advertiser values (useful for testing new designs and reserve prices)
  * Flexibility:
    * optimize the placement of ads simultaneously with other content (posts from friends, news stories) as one big optimization problem
    * accommodate different kinds of bids (e.g. for a click from a rich ad vs a simple ad)
    * accommodate different kinds of ads (e.g. highly relevant ads may be "resized" and shown in place of other less relevant ads)




----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Early Auctions: First Price
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

* Problems:
  * low quality ads, unlikely to receive clicks, could win high positions on a page by placing high bids
    * low payments and annoying ads
  * bidding wars

## Advertising Auctions: First Price Revival
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

<img data-src="img/first.png"  height="200" width="800">


----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Design Tradeoffs
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->

* Reasons in favor of First Price:
  * Transparency:
    * e.g. Google is both bidder and seller on real-time exchanges, leading to concerns about whether they are preferencing some bidders over others.
  * Composability:
    * Bidders (Demand Side Plattforms - DSPs) in ad exchanges are themselves often run an internal auction between their clients
    * DSPs then send a single bid, representing the winner, holding back other bids in order to keep prices lower. 
    * Because of this bid censoring, the exchange does not see the true second-price when running a SPSB. 
  * Analytics:
    * Bid censoring in second-price auctions has also made analytics tools difficult to develop.

# Position Auctions



----


<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Notation

> * Agents: `$ N = \{ 1, ..., n \} $`
> * Positions (Slots): `$ M = \{ 1, ..., m. \} $`
>   * ordered from top to bottom, with position 1 being the best, m the worst
>   * m < n 
> * Value-per-click: `$ v_i \geq 0 $`
>   * willingness-to-pay independent of the position from which the click originates
> * Bid-per-click: `$ b_i \geq 0 $`
>   * perhaps `$ b_i \neq v_i $`



----


<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Modeling Click-Through Rates
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->


* Improved prediction capability with machine learning (esp. deep learning via neural networks) of:
  * ad quality on the basis of relevant features (e.g., user demographic, search term, landing page quality (to avoid click bait), the ad creative)
  * click-through rates on different ad qualities in different positions on a page.

* Click-through rate on an ad as __separable__ function of the ad's quality and the position effect:
  * bidders vary wrt. value-per-click and ad quality
  * but have __same__ relatise position effect (i.e. value for positions) 
  * independent of what other ads are shown in other positions



----


<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Modeling Click-Through Rates


> * Click-through rate for the ad from bidder i in position j:
>   * `$ \text{CTR}_{ij} = \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i  $`

> * Normalized ad quality: `$ Q_i \in [0.1] $`
>   * `$ Q_i = 1 $` for ads with the highest possible quality.
>   * determines the relative click-through rate for different ads
>   * may depend, e.g., on the relevance of the ad to a user, and brand strength, landing page quality

> * Position effect: `$ \text{pos}_j \in [0.1] $`
>   * weakly decreasing with position: `$ \text{pos}_1 \geq \text{pos}_2 \geq ... \geq \text{pos}_m $`
>   * `$ \text{pos}_{m + 1} = 0$`
>   * probability that an ad with quality `$ Q_i = 1 $` will receive one click in position j.


----


<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Modeling Click-Through Rates
<!-- .element: class="no-toc-progress" -->


> * Expected value of bidder i for position `$ j \in M $`: 
>   * `$ v_{ij} = \text{CTR}_{ij} \cdot v_i = \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i \cdot v_i $`
> * Based on estimated ad quality, a per-click bid, `$ b_i $`, translates into an __effective bid__ `$ b_{ij} $` for each position j:
>   * `$ b_{ij} =  \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i \cdot b_i $`


----


<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Rank-by-Expected-Value

* Assignment of bids to positions: `$ z = (z_1, ... , z_n) $` such that `$ z_i \in M $`
* Instead of ranking by bid-per-click: `$ b_1 \geq b_2  \geq ... \geq b_n  $`
* Ranking by expected bid value: `$ Q_1 \cdot b_1 \geq Q_2 \cdot b_2  \geq ... \geq Q_n \cdot b_n  $`
  * advertisers compete on ad quality (rather than value per click)
  * better user experience (less irrelevant ads)
  * finds an efficient allocation (assuming separable click-through rate model)
    * maximizes `$ \sum\limits_{i \in N} v_{i}(z) $`

# VCG Position Auction


----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Definition

* reported valuation function of bidder i for assignment z, given bid-per-click `$ b_i $`:
> `$ \hat{v_i}(z) = \begin{cases} \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i \cdot b_i \text{     if } j = z_i, j \neq \emptyset \\ 0 \text{      otherwise.} \end{cases} $`  


<div class="fragment" />

<br>

> <mark>Definition (VCG Position Auction)</mark>: Given bids-per-click `$ b = ( b_1, ..., b_n ) $`, ordered `$ Q_1 \cdot b_1 \geq Q_2 \cdot b_2  \geq ... \geq Q_n \cdot b_n  $`:
>* The allocation rule `$ x_{vcg} $` uses rank-by-expected-value, selecting assignment `$ z^{*} $` that assigns ad 1 to position 1, ad 2 to position 2, and so forth.
>* The payment rule `$ t_{vcg} $` charges bidder i `$ (i \leq m) $` the amount <br>
> `$ t_{vcg,i}(b) = \sum\limits_{k \neq i} \hat{v}_{k}(z^{-i}) - \sum\limits_{k \neq i} \hat{v}_{k}(z^{*}) = \sum\limits_{k = i + 1}^{m + 1} (pos_{k-1} - pos_k) \cdot Q_k \cdot b_k$`  
>where `$ z^{-1} $` is the assignment that would be made without bidder i. An unallocated bidder is charged zero.

## Intuition

<img data-src="img/positions.png"  height="200" width="900">


----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Price-per-Click

* The VCG position auction is strategy-proof and allocatively efficient (standard properties of VCG).
  * dominant strategy to bid an amount per-click equal to the value per-click
* Payment can also be expressed as an equivalent price-per-click: `$ t_{vcg,i}(b) = pos_i \cdot Q_k \cdot p_{vcg,i}(b)$`  

* VCG price-per-click:
> `$ p_{vcg,i}(b) = \frac{t_{vcg,i}(b)}{Q_i \cdot pos_i } = \frac{1}{Q_i \cdot pos_i } \sum\limits_{k = i + 1}^{m + 1} (pos_{k-1} - pos_k) \cdot Q_k \cdot b_k$` 

----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Expected Utility

* VCG expected utility:

<br> 

> `$ u_{vcg,i}(b) =  \text{CTR}_{ij} \cdot v_i - t_{vcg,i}(b) = \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i \cdot v_i - t_{vcg,i}(b) $` <br> <br>
> `$ u_{vcg,i}(b) =  \text{CTR}_{ij} \cdot (v_i - p_{vcg,i}(b)) = \text{pos}_j \cdot Q_i \cdot (v_i - p_{vcg,i}(b))$` 

----

<!-- .slide: class="align-top" -->

## Example

* Assume `$ Q_i = 1 $` for all bidders
* 3 slots: `$ pos_1 = 0.2 $`; `$ pos_2 = 0.18 $`; `$ pos_3 = 0.1 $`
* 4 bidders: `$ v_1 = 10 $`; `$ v_2 = 4 $`; `$ v_3 = 2 $`; `$ v_4 = 1 $`
* Calculate the VCG payments, VCG prices-per-click and the expected utilities!
